# Instructions

- This is an attempt to carry out the steps given in Section 3.1 of Astrom's 1995 paper *Oscillations in systems with relay feedback*
- The main function `sym_osc_analysis.m`, tells if a given system has a stable limit cycle.
- Dependencies for the main function are `step1.m`,`step2.m`,`step3.m`,`eqtn2_3.m` and `tanhm.m`
- Currently, the code works for Examples 1 and 2 from Astrom's paper.
- Need to work on dealing with solutions where a range of limit cycle time periods are possible, such as Examples 3 and 4
